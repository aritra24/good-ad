<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

Non Profits undertake work that is important for the society and they truly help make our world a better place. As such, at a lot of Non Profits, there aren't a lot of funds to spare for publicity and expensive ad campaings. However, getting their word out and raising more funding for their initiatives is also important. Good Ads aims to solve this problem by developing an ad platform where the barrier to publicizing a non profit and raising funds is \$0, unlike other platforms like GoogleAds and FacebookAds where a significant upfront is required.

**TL;DR**

- Advertisers(Non Profits) can start running ads free of charge through GoodAds
- Publishers(People who run any kind of website - Cooking Blogs, entertainment news, fitness tips etc) display our ads on their website just like any other ad service
- Visitors (Users who visit a Publisher's website) see these ads and may make a donation to a Non Profit
- GoodAds keeps a small percentage(say 5%) of the donation to run the platform and pay the publishers
